I started of learning the web development few weeks back. I was interested to know, how the HTML, CSS and JS works to create a webpage.  That's why I developed it for my understanding.

The purpose of this webpage is very simple. As I said before it's just for my understanding. The webpage might be childish for everyone. Definitely there will be many mistake you(devlopers) will notice. 
It's just a beginning and I will improve it in better way.

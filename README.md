I started of learning the web development few weeks back. I was interested to know, how the HTML, CSS and JS works to create a webpage.  That's why I developed it for my understanding.

The purpose of this webpage is very simple. As I said before it's just for my understanding. The webpage might be childish for everyone. Definitely there will be many mistake you(devlopers) will notice. 
It's just a beginning and I will improve it in better way.

FUNCTIONS OF THIS WEBPAGE :
This webpage contains two ways of remembering the task
      - Add ToDo : It will store the task with some description and due time.
      - Stick Task : Simply stick the task 
 Like add the task, we can delete the task also
 
 Disadvantages: We cannot save the task. It's just for like one time use. I tried to save the tasks in the local storage, but I don't have enough clarity on storing it in the local storage. So it's not included as of now. It will be updated later definitely.
